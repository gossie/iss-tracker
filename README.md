# ISS tracker

The application retrieves the position of the ISS using the REST service of [wheretheiss](https://wheretheiss.at/). The position is then rendered on a map.
The main reason for the implementation was to get used to react hooks. There is no guarantee that the shown position was correctly calculated.
